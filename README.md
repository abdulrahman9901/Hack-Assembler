## Usage/Examples

The program can have any number of input but they must me in same directory in folder called inputs
and the outputs folder will contain the resultant machinde code files .

in project directory we open cmd 
and write the following command 

```bash
assembler.exe file1.asm file2.asm file3.asm ...etc
```

the output will be file1.hack , file2.hack , file3.hack ...etc

and these files are ready to be loaded to the CPU emulator to verfy that they do the required tasks .
